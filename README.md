# Welcome to Composty!
Composty is a web application that promotes sustainability amongst youths through an interactive, educational . With functionality ranging from a game to a FAQ section, Composty acts as an educational hub for young students interested in making the world a greener place. Our project — created entirely within a 5-hour timeframe — used tools including JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

Functions of the project include a drag-and-drop game of items that can and cannot be composted, in addition to an informative Q&A section.

To view our web application, please head to https://lilcomposty.aleajane.repl.co/  - we hope you enjoy it!
